                Also known as weak AI, this is the only type of AI that currently exists. It is designed and trained for a specific, narrow task. While it can seem highly intelligent in its domain, it cannot perform tasks outside of its predefined programming.

            <h2>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</h2>
            <p>
                Also known as strong AI, this is a theoretical concept where an AI possesses human-level intelligence and can understand, learn, and apply its knowledge to solve any problem. AGI would be able to learn across different domains and apply its intelligence flexibly.
</p>
            <p>
                Status: AGI does not exist yet and remains a major goal for many AI researchers.
